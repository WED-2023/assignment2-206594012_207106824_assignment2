Welcome to **Space Battle**, a browser-based arcade-style space shooting game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Gameplay

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen. Your mission is to shoot down all the incoming enemy ships before time runs out or before you lose all your lives.

  - Top row: 20 points
  - Second row: 15 points
  - Third row: 10 points
  - Bottom row: 5 points
- The game is timed. When time runs out, your final score will be evaluated.
- You start with 3 lives. Lose all and the game is over.
